<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver uses nature as a springboard to the sacred-the beating heart of her work. </p>

<p> "Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel <a href="The Anthologist,">"The Anthologist"</a> scrawls in the margins of Oliver's <a href ="New and Selected Poems, Volume One.">"New and Selected Poems, Volume One."</a> A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, **They're very simple. And yet each has something." </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know exactly what a prayer is  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is what I have been doing all day  </p>

<p> The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere</p>
